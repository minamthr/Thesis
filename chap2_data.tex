\chapter{Observation data \& Analysis
\label{chap:Orion-KL}}

In this chapter, we report the tentatively detection CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ in Orion-KL.

\section{Observation data}
We analyzed 2 ALMA archival data. First we used Cycle 2 data (ADS/JAO.ALMA\#2013.1.00553.S, 
\cite{Pagani+2017}) 
We also employed the ALMA Science Verification (SV) data (ADS/JAO.ALMA\#2011.0.00009.SV) 
at band 6 to fill up the missing frequency coverage of Cycle 2 data.

Details of each data are summarized in Table \ref{tab:Obs_Ori}.

Cycle 2 data cube was already calibrated by Pagani et al., and the reduced data are available on 
the web site of CDS (Centre de Donnees astronomiques de Strasbourg)\footnote{http://cdsarc.u-strasbg.fr/viz-bin/qcat?J/A+A/604/A32}.
Since the SV data contained not only line emission but continuum emission, 
we subtracted continuum emission statistically by the method described in Section \ref{sec:Statcont}.

In addition, we used Common Astronomy Software Applications (CASA) software \citep{McMullin+2007} 
during the procedure to analyze observational data.

\section{Analysis}
\subsection{Reduction of SV data}
\label{sec:Statcont}

With the advent of highly sensitive facilities such as ALMA, the spectral lines which were hindered 
by the noise level with previous telescope can now be detected.
Most of these line-rich sources including hot cores are associated with detectable continuum emission.
In the analysis of molecular emission lines, the determination and the subtraction of this continuum 
emission is an essential, but difficult task. 
Therefore, we improved the method devised in \citet{Sanchez-Monge+2017} and deduced continuum subtraction 
in the observed UV domain (the raw visibilities measured by the interferometer).
We introduce the method and results in this section.

\subsubsection*{Determination of the continuum level}
The determination of the continuum emission level of astronomical sources observed in a spectral line 
observing mode is based on the identification of channels free of line emission, i.e. line-free channels.

First, we obtain the spectra for which we want to estimate the continuum level.  
In the case of Orion-KL, many molecular emission exist in Hot core
(RA$_{J2000}: 05^{\rm{h}}35^{\rm{m}}14^{\rm{s}}.580$, Dec$_{J2000}:-05^{\circ}22'31''.029$) or 
Compact ridge (RA$_{J2000}: 05^{\rm{h}}35^{\rm{m}}14^{\rm{s}}.2775$, Dec$_{J2000}:-05^{\circ}22'30''.776$), 
so we extracted spectra from circular regions with a diameter of 1''.0  with the coordinates indicated by 
\citet{Hirota+2015} as the center.
The peak of the distribution of the intensity values is determined with a Gaussian fit 
by assuming the Gaussian random error distribution with the mean value $E$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$
The width is small in case of pixels with little or no line emission, but for line contaminated 
regions the distribution becomes broader and the exact location of the peak more uncertain. 
Therefore, we set the range of the Gaussian fitting from 0 to 1/3 of the peak intensity in line contaminated side,
and calculated the mean value $E$ and the standard deviation $\sigma$ (see Figure \ref{fig:histo}).

\subsubsection*{Imaging line cubes}
Subsequently, the part of the distribution within $E - 3\sigma$ is defined as line-free channels.
Hot core and Compact ridges have different spectrums because of the disparate chemical composition, 
so we determined the line-free channels individually and subtracted the continuum
in the UV domain by CASA task {\sc uvcontsub} with channels common to the two regions.
After the continuum subtraction, line cubes of Orion-KL were made using the CASA task {\sc clean}.

Figure \ref{SVspec} shows examples of original and continuum-subtracted spectra towards Hot core. 
Since the base line defined in this analysis seems to be reasonable, the continuum subtraction has succeeded.

  together with its uncertainty, is listed in the upper right part of each panel.}

\subsection{Line identification}
In order to find out where common signals exist, we drew integrated intensity maps 
using CASA task {\sc immoment}. The integrated velocity range is 3.0-12.0 km s$^{-1}$, corresponding to
typical velocity component of Hot core (4.8-6 km s$^{-1}$) and that of Compact ridge 
(7.2-9.6~km~s$^{-1}$) \citep{Feng+2015}.
Spectroscopic data of CH$_3$NH$_2$ are provided by \citet{Motiyenko+2014} and 
JPL Molecular Spectroscopy catalog\footnote{http://spec.jpl.nasa.gov}.

Then, since emission at the center of Hot core were found in most of integrated intensity maps, 
we extracted spectrum for transitions with no line blending around $\pm$2 km~s$^{-1}$ from Hot core.
Possible line blending ( just considering the transitions $E_{\mathrm{u}} < 500\, \mathrm{K}$) with CH$_{3}$NH$_{2}$ was investigated by JPL database, 
the Cologne database for molecular spectroscopy (CDMS)\footnote{http://www.astro.uni-koeln.de/cdms/}, 
and Splatalogue\footnote{http://www.splalogue.net/}. 

Subsequently, we estimated the systemic velocity and the line width of 217.758~GHz line, which is reported by \citet{Pagani+2017} and does not seem contaminated by other molecular lines by the Gaussian fitting.
At last, adopting the systemic velocity and the line width of the 217.758~GHz line to other transitions, 
we obtained the integrated intensity of 6~transitions described in Table \ref{tab:MAOri}.
