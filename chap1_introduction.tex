\section{Origin of life}
The interstellar medium (ISM), where more than 190 molecules ranging from simple
linear molecules to complex organic molecules (hereafter COMs) were detected, show
chemically rich environment. Astronomers usually regard the species with more than six
atoms as COMs. Not only O-bearing species, CH3OH, CH3OCH3, HCOOCH3, but also
N-bearing species such as CH3CH2CN and CH2CHCN are known COMs. In 2016, a chiral
molecule propylene oxide (CH3CHHCH2O) was detected towards Sgr B2 (N) molecular
cloud in absorption (McGuire et al. 2016). This detection implies that molecules can get
sufficient complexity, and it will accelerate surveys of other chiral molecules, like amino
acids.
From this point of view, many observations were conducted to search for prebiotic
molecules in the ISM, which might turn into the Seeds of Life when delivered to a
planetary surface. Especially, a great attention was paid to amino acids, essential building
blocks of terrestrial life; many surveys were made unsuccessfully to search for the simplest
amino acid, glycine (NH2CH2COOH), towards Sgr B2 and other high-mass star forming
regions (e.g., Brown et al. 1979; Snyder et al. 1983; Combes et al. 1996). In 2003, Kuan
et al. (2003) claimed the rst detection of glycine, however, several follow-up observations
concluded denied the detection (e.g., Jones et al. 2007). The difficulty of the past glycine
surveys would be originated from potential weakness of glycine lines and low sensitivities of
telescopes used for the surveys.
