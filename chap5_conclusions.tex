In order to ascertain whether the presence of CH$_3$NH$_2$, a precursor of glycine, in the star-formation regions is universal  
 and further to accelerate the discussion regarding the exogenous delivery of 
prebiotic species to planets and connection between the Universe and life,
we explored the existence of CH$_3$NH$_2$ in 3 star-forming regions using ALMA archival data.

As a result of the analysis, CH$_3$NH$_2$ was not detected in low mass star-forming regions 
(see Appendix A), but some emission lines was detected in Orion-KL.

According to the analysis, the physical properties of CH$_3$NH$_2$ were found as follows.
\begin{itemize}
\item From the integrated intensity maps, CH$_3$NH$_2$ concentrates in Hot Core.
\item $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ and FWHM line width are estimated to be 4.84~$\pm$~0.22~km~s$^{-1}$ 
and 4.16~$\pm$~0.22~km~s$^{-1}$, respectively. $V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ are consistent with 
those of N-bearing COMs observed toward Hot core.
On the other hand, $\Delta V_{1/2}$ of CH$_3$NH$_2$ is narrower than those of other molecule in Hot core.
\item By using the rotation diagram method, we evaluated its $T_{\mathrm{rot}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{MA}}$ to be $95.4^{+15.5}_{-11.7} \,\,\mathrm{K}$, and $ (\,5.5^{+1.6}_{-1.1}\,) \times 10^{14} \,\,\mathrm{cm^{-2}}$,  respectively.
\end{itemize}

The distribution and spectrum parameters ($V_{\mathrm{LSR}}$ and FWHM line width) of CH$_3$NH$_2$ in Orion-KL is reported for the first time.
Regarding its rotational temperature and column density, we gave more restrictions than previous studies.

However, since contamination is not sufficiently studied, this detection is still tentative.
We need further line identification including other frequency bands to constrain $T_{\mathrm{rot}}$ and $N_{\mathrm{MA}}$.
